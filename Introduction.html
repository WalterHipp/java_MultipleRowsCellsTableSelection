<h2>Introduction to MultipleRowsSelection</h2>
In the past, i was seeking a way to do a multiple select on java JTables,</br>
with rows, cells and columns in a JTable, or select parts of them.</br>
I couldn’t find any code in the web to do so. I found some examples</br>
to do a column select, or multiple row select. But there was nothing</br>
to do a selection with parts of rows, like making text selections in</br>
a word processing program.</br></br>
So i had to do it myself.</br>
SAnd for now i reached the light at the end of the way to can do so.</br>
If you have to use JTables with an option to do a selection with parts</br>
of rows, than i invite you to relax and make use of the code you will find</br>
at this place.</br>
I think there is clearly a need for a new way to do selections with JTables,</br>
beside the existing methods. I have found many, more or less useful examples,</br>
in the web to do selections in JTables. But now enough the words, lets see what i mean:</br></br>
